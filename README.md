# Object Oriented Design -- Final Assigment

Course: Object-Oriented Programming (UOC)
Program: Master’s in Game Development

## Project overview

Final assigment for a object oriented design course.
In this assignment I created an application that simulates the blackout and the recovery of an electric grid.

## Architecture overview:
The application follows a Model–View–Controller (MVC) architecture.
In this assignment I was responsible for designing, implementing and testing the model and also connecting it to the controller.

For the architecture look at the class diagram:

## Object Oriented analysis:
In the model I used common OOD concepts such as, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritence, Polimorphism and SOLID principles.

## Obtained grade:
I got the maximum grade for this assignment.
