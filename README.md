# Object Oriented Design -- Final Assigment
Final assigment for a object oriented design course at the UOC university, as part of my master in Game development program. 
In this assignment I was responsible for designing, implementing and testing the model for an application that simulates the blackout and the recovery of an electric grid.
The application follows a vista/controller/model architecture, in this case I designed the model and connected the controller to it. 
In the model I used common OOD concepts such as, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritence, Polimorphism and SOLID principles.
