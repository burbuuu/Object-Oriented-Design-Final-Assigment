## Project overview

- Final assigment for a object oriented design course.
- In this assignment I created an application that simulates the blackout and the recovery of an electric grid.

## Architecture overview:
- The application implements a Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìController (MVC) architecture.
- In this assignment I was responsible for designing, implementing and testing the model and also connecting it to the controller.

For the architecture look at the class diagram:

## Object Oriented analysis:
- In the model I used common OOD concepts such as, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritence, Polimorphism and SOLID principles.



## Obtained grade:
- I got the maximum grade for this assignment.
- The model is modular and extensible.
